			I don&apos;t like licenses, because I don&apos;t like having to worry about all this
			legal stuff just for a simple piece of software I don&apos;t really mind anyone
			using. But I also believe that it&apos;s important that people share and give back;
			so I&apos;m placing this work under the following license.
