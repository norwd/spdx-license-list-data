You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5.

You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward.
