### Permitted Purpose

A Permitted Purpose is any purpose other than a Competing Use. A Competing Use means making the Software available to others in a commercial product or service that:

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; substitutes for any other product or service we offer using the Software that exists as of the date we make the Software available; or
   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; offers the same or substantially similar functionality as the Software.
Permitted Purposes specifically include using the Software:

   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="1.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; for your internal use and access;
   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="2.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; for non-commercial education;
   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="3.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; for non-commercial research; and
   &lt;&lt;var;name="bullet";original="4.";match=".{0,20}"&gt;&gt; in connection with professional services that you provide to a licensee using the Software in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.
### Patents

To the extent your use for a Permitted Purpose would necessarily infringe our patents, the license grant above includes a license under our patents. If you make a claim against any party that the Software infringes or contributes to the infringement of any patent, then your patent license to the Software ends immediately.
