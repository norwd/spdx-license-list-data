This file may be freely copied and distributed, provided that
no changes whatsoever are made. All users are asked to help keep
the MMIXware files consistent and ``uncorrupted,''
identical everywhere in the world. Changes are permissible only
if the modified file is given a new name, different from the names of
existing files in the MMIXware package,
and only if the modified file is clearly identified
as not being part of that package.
(The CWEB system has a ``change file'' facility by
which users can easily make minor alterations without modifying
the master source files in any way. Everybody is supposed to use
change files instead of changing the files.)
The author has tried his best to produce correct and useful programs,
in order to help promote computer science research,
but no warranty of any kind should be assumed.
