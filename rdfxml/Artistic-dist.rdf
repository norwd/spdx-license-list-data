    <spdx:licenseText>The "Artistic License"
 
                             Preamble
 
The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the Package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
reasonable modifications.
 
It also grants you the rights to reuse parts of a Package in your own
programs without transferring this License to those programs, provided
that you meet some reasonable requirements.
 
Definitions:
 
        "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
        Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
        created through textual modification.
 
        "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
        modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
        of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
 
        "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
        copyrights for the package.
 
        "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
        this Package.
 
        "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
        basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
        and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
        Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
        as a market that must bear the fee.)
 
        "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
        itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
        It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
        under the same conditions they received it.
 
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
following:
 
    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 
    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
 
    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 
    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
    to get the Standard Version.
 
    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
    the Package with your modifications.
 
    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
 
    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
product of your own.
 
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
Package.
 
7. You may reuse parts of this Package in your own programs, provided that
you explicitly state where you got them from, in the source code (and, left
to your courtesy, in the documentation), duplicating all the associated
copyright notices and disclaimers. Besides your changes, if any, must be
clearly marked as such. Parts reused that way will no longer fall under this
license if, and only if, the name of your program(s) have no immediate
connection with the name of the Package itself or its associated programs.
You may then apply whatever restrictions you wish on the reused parts or
choose to place them in the Public Domain--this will apply only within the
context of your package.
 
8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
 
9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

               You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution
               of this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support
               of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package
               itself. However, you may distribute this Package in aggregate
               with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger
               (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that
               you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.
            &lt;/li&gt;

               The scripts and library files supplied as input to or
               produced as output from the programs of this Package do
               not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package,
               but belong to whoever generated them, and may be sold
               commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
               If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
               Package via the so-called &amp;quot;undump&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;unexec&amp;quot; methods of
               producing a binary executable image, then distribution of
               such an image shall neither be construed as a distribution
               of this Package nor shall it fall under the restrictions of
               Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do not represent such
               an executable image as a Standard Version of this Package.
            &lt;/li&gt;

               &lt;var class="replaceable-license-text"&gt;&lt;span title="can be replaced with the pattern .{0,20}"&gt; 7.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/var&gt;
               You may reuse parts of this Package in your own programs,
               provided that you explicitly state where you got them from,
               in the source code (and, left to your courtesy, in the
               documentation), duplicating all the associated copyright notices
               and disclaimers. Besides your changes, if any, must be clearly
               marked as such. Parts reused that way will no longer fall under
               this license if, and only if, the name of your program(s) have no
               immediate connection with the name of the Package itself or its
               associated programs. You may then apply whatever restrictions you
               wish on the reused parts or choose to place them in the Public
               Domain--this will apply only within the context of your package.
            &lt;/li&gt;
