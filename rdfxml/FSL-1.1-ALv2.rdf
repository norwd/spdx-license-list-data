Permitted Purposes specifically include using the Software:

1. for your internal use and access;

2. for non-commercial education;

3. for non-commercial research; and

4. in connection with professional services that you provide to a licensee
   using the Software in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.

### Patents

To the extent your use for a Permitted Purpose would necessarily infringe our
patents, the license grant above includes a license under our patents. If you
make a claim against any party that the Software infringes or contributes to
the infringement of any patent, then your patent license to the Software ends
immediately.

### Redistribution

The Terms and Conditions apply to all copies, modifications and derivatives of
the Software.

If you redistribute any copies, modifications or derivatives of the Software,
you must include a copy of or a link to these Terms and Conditions and not
remove any copyright notices provided in or with the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR

IN NO EVENT WILL WE HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
SOFTWARE, INCLUDING INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY IN ADVANCE.

the Software, you have no right under these Terms and Conditions to use our
trademarks, trade names, service marks or product names.
